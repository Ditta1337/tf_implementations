# Deep learning models implemented in TensorFlow

Here I will implement and train models from Computer Vision, NLP, Forecasting and maybe something more with use of TensorFlow.

My thought process and other visualizations with the core code will be documented in Jupyter notebooks

Models created so far:
  - Computer Vision:
      - multiclass classification of German road signs (98% test accuracy)
